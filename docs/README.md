# Git LFS Documentation

## Reference Manual

Each Git LFS subcommand is documented in the [official man pages](man). Any of
these can be viewed from the command also:

```bash
$ git lfs help <command>
$ git lfs <command> -h
```

## Developer Docs

Details of how the Git LFS client work are in the [official specification](spec.md).
There is also an [API specification](api) that describes how the server works.
